# Full_Stack_Project

The Local Food Waste Reduction System is a MERN-based full-stack platform designed to reduce local food wastage by connecting individuals who have surplus food with those who need it. The platform follows a single merged user role, allowing any user to donate or receive food based on their needs.

Users can post food items with details like name, expiry time, location, and images, while others can easily browse and claim available items through a smooth, real-time interface built with React Hooks. The platform includes secure JWT + bcrypt authentication and provides instant notifications (email or toast) when a food item is claimed.

A special volunteer feature enables registered volunteers to help pick up and deliver food items to receivers who cannot travel, improving accessibility for the elderly, disabled, or distant users. The system maintains a mobile-responsive design and is deployed using Vercel for the frontend and Render for the backend to ensure reliable performance
